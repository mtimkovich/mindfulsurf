Mindfulsurf is a Chrome extension that allows you to to add a small delay (3 seconds by default) to certain sites. The goal is to not block, but to minorly inconvenience visiting common time-wasting sites (e.g. social media).

Google research found that 53% of users give up on site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load[<sup>1</sup>][data]. Do you care so little that you can't wait 3 seconds? Mindfulsurf serves as a deterrent, but also acts as a gentle reminder to take some time during your browsing to do some mindful breathing.

## Usage

The extension is disabled by default. In the extension's options you can:
- Enable / disable the extension
- Modify the delay amount
- Specify a list of affected sites

## Installation

1. Code → Download ZIP
2. Extract
3. Manage extensions → Load unpacked

## TODO

- [x] Update README and description to give it a mindfulness angle
- [x] Add options page to customize timeout and blacklist sites
- [x] Add icons
- [ ] Improve site matching code
