Mindfulsurf is a Chrome extension that allows you to to add a small delay (3 seconds by default) to certain sites. The goal is to not block, but to add a minor inconvenience to visiting common time wasting sites (e.g. social media).

Google research found that 53% of users give up on site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load[<sup>1</sup>][data]. Do you care enough about viewing that webpage that you're willing to wait 3 seconds? It also serves as a gentle reminder to take some time to do some mindful breathing.

## Usage

The extension is disabled by default. In the extension's options you can:
- Enable / disable the extension
- Modify the delay amount
- Specify a list of affected sites

## Installation

1. Code → Download ZIP
