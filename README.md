Mindfulsurf is a Chrome extension that allows you to to add a small delay (3 seconds by default) to certain sites. The goal is to not block, but to minorly inconvenience the act of visiting common time-wasting sites (e.g. social media, shopping). It can serve as a gentle in-browser reminder to come back to your breath.

## Usage

The extension is disabled by default. In the options you can:
- Enable / disable
- Modify the delay length
- Specify a list of affected sites

## Installation

1. Code → Download ZIP or `git clone`
2. Extract
3. Manage extensions → Load unpacked

## TODO

- [x] Update README and description to give it a mindfulness angle
- [x] Add options page to customize timeout and blacklist sites
- [x] Add icons
- [x] Improve site matching code
